# coding-interview-study-guide
This repository contains the notes I collected to prepare for a coding interview. These notes are based on the popular book: [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850).

## Chapter 1: Arrays & Strings
#### Hash Tables:
* A data structure that maps keys to values for highly efficient look up.

#### ArrayLists & Resizable Arrays

#### StringBuilder
#### Supplemental Topics:
  + ##### Enumeration vs. Iterator
  + ##### Collection Interface 
#### Interview Questions:
  + <b>1.1 Is Unique<b>: 
  + 1.2 Check Permutation:
  + 1.3 URLify:
  + 1.4 Palindrome Permutation:
  + 1.5 One Away:
  + 1.6 String Compression:
  + 1.7 Rotate Matrix:
  + 1.8 Zero Matrix:
  + 1.9 String Rotation:
  
## Chapter 2: LinkedList

#### Interview Questions:
* <b>2.1 RemoveDups</b>: 
  Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.
  + <b>2.3 Return Kth to Last</b>: Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list.
  + 2.3 Delete Middle Node: Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e. any node but the first and last node) of a singly linked list, given only access to that node.
  + 2.4 Partition: 
  + 2.5 Sum Lists: 
  + 2.6 Palindrome: Check if a linked list is a palindrome.
  + 2.7 Intersection: 
  + 2.8 Loop Detection: Given a circular linked list, return the node at the beginning of the loop.

## Chapter 3: Stacks & Queues:

#### Interview Questions:
  + 3.1 Three in One: Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks.
  + 3.2 Stack Min: How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, has a function min, which returns the minimum element? Push, pop and min should all operate in O(1) time.
  + 3.3 Stack of Plates: Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. 
  + 3.4 Queue via Stacks: Implement a MyQueue class which implements a queue using two stacks.
  + 3.5 Sort Stack: Sort a stack such that the smallest items are on the top.
  + 3.6 Animal Shelter:
